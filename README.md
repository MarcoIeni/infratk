# Infra Tool Kit

Utility for managing Rust [simpleinfra](https://github.com/rust-lang/simpleinfra).

## Features

- Apply the current branch's changes to every affected Terraform/Terragrunt
  root module, logging into each AWS account and preserving the normal apply
  confirmation prompt. Fetches the default branch from `origin` before calculating
  changes, using the updated remote reference as the comparison base
- Update Terragrunt states verifying that the changes don't edit the state
- Run `plan` for every lockfile of a PR
- Show the dependency graph of the modules

## Useful aliases

```bash
alias ill='eval "$(infratk legacy-login)"'
alias icd='eval "$(infratk cd)"'
```
